## 🎮 What Is a Wallhack in DRG?

A **wallhack (ESP)** is a cheat that overlays real-time visual data over your game screen — letting you see:

* 📦 **Ores** (Nitra, Gold, Jadiz, Bismor, Umanite, etc.)
* 🐜 **Enemies** (Swarmers, Spitters, Grunts, etc.)
* 🥚 **Eggs, Aquarqs, Fossils, and mission objectives**
* 🧭 **M.U.L.E., Drop Pod, and Doretta’s location**
* 🧠 **Team status** (HP, distance, class)

Whether you're solo or squadding, this is a **huge advantage** in Deep Rock’s dark, procedural caves.
